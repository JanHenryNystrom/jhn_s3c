Build
-----

jhn_s3c requires [rebar3][1] to build, but provides make support to download
and install rebar. To build jhn_s3c, go to the jhn_s3c directory and type:

```sh
make
```

To make sure jhn_s3c works on your platform, run the tests (reuquires docker):

```sh
make ci
```

Should you find yourself using jhn_s3c and have issues, comments or
feedback please [create an issue here on GitHub.] [2]

Patches are greatly appreciated, but since these libraries reflect my
learning process and I have rather peculiar notions of code hygiene

For a much nicer history, please [write good commit messages][4].
I know I really should.
